Packet Interview Tech Challenge
Name: Henry Morocho



Knowledge of C/JAVA and UART protocols helped to understand HTTP/HTTPS and Go documentations. Using Visual Studio
and the Golang extension I complied main.go.  I learned how to provide Authentication token, since most of the endpoints
in Packet’s API require authentication. Typically, the Authorization Key should be provided in JSON or YAML files.  Go makes it easier to 
develop an application that uses the Packet API to access the routines and protocols when receiving 
information such as package id’s. Sending a request when creating a device and with JSON configuration to retrieve
specific information such as Device UUID.

Packet Interview Tech Challenge
Name: Henry Morocho


Knowledge of C/JAVA and UART protocols helped to understand HTTP/HTTPS and Go documentations. Using Visual Studio and the Golang extension I complied main.go.  I learned how to provide Authentication token, since most of Packet APIâ€™s endpoints require authentication.

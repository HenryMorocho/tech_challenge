Packet Interview Tech Challenge
Name: Henry Morocho

This challange has taught me alot about what is expected of the poential intern candidate.
Interacting with API's in general was a first for me, using online resources; I became aware of
HyperText Transfer Protocol's and handling Json files/infromation. Go was also another first for me, but not hard to understand from knowldge of C and Java. Some time was spent revieving Go documentations. Alot of time was in invested in reviewing Packet API documentations. Realizing the capabilities of the API, as I learned to request information and send information.
